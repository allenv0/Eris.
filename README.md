- Subsequent runs are much faster (model stays in memory)
- For best performance, use smaller models (0.5B-1.5B)

### Troubleshooting

**"No model selected" error**
- Open Eris and download a model first
- Make sure a default model is selected in Settings

**"Model not found" error**
- Check the model name spelling
- Ensure the model is downloaded
- Try using partial names (e.g., "qwen" instead of full name)

**Shortcuts run slowly**
- First run is always slower (model loading)
- Use smaller models for better performance
- Close other apps to free memory

**Chat not saving**
- Enable "Save Chat" parameter
- Check storage space
- Ensure Eris has necessary permissions

### A Note About the Commit History üò¥

If you're browsing through the commit history and wondering why there are so many commits that just say "commit"... well, I have a confession to make. 

I started this project late one night with zero intention of it becoming anything serious. It was supposed to be a quick experiment, maybe a few lines of code to test out MLX. But you know how it goes - "just one more feature" turned into "oh, this actually works!" which turned into "wait, people might actually use this."

So there I was, half-asleep, committing code with the eloquence of a zombie: "commit", "commit", "commit". By the time I realized this was becoming a real project, the damage was done. My git history looks like I fell asleep on the keyboard with my finger on the enter key.

I promise I'm usually better at commit messages. Usually. When I'm awake. ‚òï

*PS: If you're a hiring manager reading this, I swear this isn't representative of my professional work. Please check out my other repos where I actually wrote meaningful commit messages like "fix: resolved null pointer exception in user authentication flow" instead of just "commit" 47 times in a row.*
